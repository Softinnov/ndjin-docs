Due to limitation of our underlying data storage model, the metamodel cannot contain inheritance.

== DataType ==

DataType are similar to classes in OO languages with few enhancements. 

A dataType has a name, belongs to a package, and contains:
  * fields: properties of the dataType
  * operationFields: equivalent to the object methods
  * states: set of state associated with this datatype
  * uiTypes: type of user interface that could be associated to this dataType
  * validatorTypes: type of data validator that could be associated to this dataType
  * serviceTypes: executable service that could be accessed via this dataType

Common dataType primitives are:

|| *Name* || *Description* ||
||Text||UTF-8 string||
||Number||any kind of numbers||
||Date||represented in milisecond since EPOC||
||File||any kind of file||


Specific dataType objects are:

|| *Name* || *Description* ||
||Object||base object inherited by any object of your application||
||Application||application dataType that is instantiated once and used has your application entry point||
||Member||dataType used to specify user level of the member of you application||
