Due to limitation of our underlying data storage model, the metamodel cannot contain inheritance.

== DataType ==

DataType are similar to classes in OO languages with few enhancements. 

A dataType has a name, belongs to a package, and contains:
  * fields: properties of the dataType
  * operationFields: equivalent to the object methods
  * states: set of state associated with this datatype
  * uiTypes: type of user interface that could be associated to this dataType
  * validatorTypes: type of data validator that could be associated to this dataType
  * serviceTypes: executable service that could be accessed via this dataType


== States ==

 
DataType can have states. 
A dataType instance can be in a specific state and anyone can apply a transition on the instance to change its state. When a transition is apply, a set of operation can be executed. 
Those operations can generate exception and cancel transition. Each operations are transactional but the whole transition is not transactional itself for performance reason. 
If an exception occurs during a transition, the current operation is rolled back but previous one remains. To be sure to have an atomic set of operation executed in transition you can define a specific method (operationField) and execute all operation in a transition inside this method.

== Operations == 

Operations are executed during transitions. Field operations code can be written using scripts language. Service operations are integrated in the platform.
