#summary ndjin default application model

= Introduction =

Any application created on ndjin start with a default model.

http://ndjin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/applicationModel.png

Application model can be modified dynamically using ModelService.


Common ApplicationModel dataTypes/classes primitives are:

|| *Name* || *Description* ||
||Text||UTF-8 string||
||Number||any kind of numbers||
||Date||represented in milisecond since EPOC||
||File||any kind of file||


Specific classes are:

|| *Name* || *Description* ||
||Object||base object inherited by any object of your application||
||Application||application class that is instantiated once and used has your application entry point||
||Member||dataType used to specify user level of the member of you application||


=== Object states ===

When a class (dataType) extends an existing class, it inherit of its states. So basically any classe extending `Object` class automatically gets all its states.
Of course each state could be overloaded.
